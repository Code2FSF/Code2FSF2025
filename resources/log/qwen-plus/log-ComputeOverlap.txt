start role user
为下面的代码生成FSF:
```
class ComputeOverlap {
    public int computeOverlapArea(int ax1, int ay1, int ax2, int ay2, int bx1, int by1, int bx2, int by2) {
        int area1 = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1), area2 = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1);
        int overlapWidth = (ax2<bx2?ax2:bx2) - (ax1>bx1?ax1:bx1), overlapHeight = (ay2<by2?ay2:by2) - (ay1>by1?ay1:by1);
        int overlapArea = (overlapWidth>0?overlapWidth:0) * (overlapHeight>0?overlapHeight:0);
        return overlapArea;
    }
}

```
*end* role user
start role assistant
T1: ax2 <= bx1 || bx2 <= ax1 || ay2 <= by1 || by2 <= ay1  
D1: overlapArea = 0  

T2: ax1 < bx2 && bx1 < ax2 && ay1 < by2 && by1 < ay2  
D2: overlapArea = (min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1)) * (min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1))  

T3: Input values cause overflow in area calculations  
D3: Exception
